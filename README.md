A random walk of particles over a fixed canvas, with an hidden image mask influencing
the behavior/appearance or the particles. The default color scheme is a simple grayscale
but that can easily be changed in the source code.

If you have Python installed, you can quickly see it in action by running the following
command inside the repository top folder and then browsing to `http://localhost:8000`:
```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

This is a simpler version of the sketch available in the
[master branch](https://github.com/carlosefr/BrownianMask/tree/master),
adapted for [processing.js](http://processingjs.org).
