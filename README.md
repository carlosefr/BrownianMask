A random walk of particles over a fixed canvas, with an hidden image mask influencing
the behavior/appearance or the particles. The color scheme is chosen randomly from
the 20 most popular palettes on [Kuler](https://kuler.adobe.com/). To run this you'll
need the following:

  - http://processing.org
  - https://github.com/hellonico/colorlib (binary jar: [download](http://cloud.carlos-rodrigues.com/processing/colorLib.jar))

You can watch a video for this here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjVtBkHGwFg

While the application is running, pressing _space_ restarts the painting with new colors, pressing 'r' starts/stops recording and 'c' captures a snapshot.
